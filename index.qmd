subtitle: "Direction: things I wish I knew earlier"

> **Anfet** (Tigrinya) means **Direction** — the kind you wish someone had handed you before you learned the hard way.

This book is a practical map: lessons, mental models, and habits that make life easier to navigate.  
Not because life becomes simple, but because *you see the terrain sooner* — the incentives, the hidden rules, the trade-offs, and the moves that compound.

## Who this is for
- Youth and learners who didn’t have access to mentors, networks, or “insider” information
- Anyone starting over, changing direction, or trying to grow faster with fewer regrets
- Curious people who want a clearer model of how the world works — at home, at work, and in society

## How this book is organized
- The parts move from **self** → **skills** → **work** → **money** → **relationships** → **society** → **the long game**.
- Each chapter is built to be skimmable and useful. You’ll usually find:
  - **Aha moments** — the insight that changed how I see things
  - **Failure lessons** — what cost me time, confidence, or opportunity
  - **Rules of the game** — written and unwritten rules (incentives, status, power, norms)
  - **Exercises** — small actions you can do this week
  - **Stories** — examples from real life (including mine) to make it concrete

## How to read it
- Read it like a **toolkit**, not a textbook.
- Start with the chapter that matches your current problem.
- Keep one note titled **“Anfet — Lessons”** and write:
  - what surprised you
  - what you will do differently
  - what you’ll test this week

## A small promise
If you apply even a few ideas here consistently, you’ll gain two things:
1. **Better direction** — fewer wasted loops  
2. **More leverage** — small actions that compound over time
